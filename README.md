To-Do List App
This is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app also supports persistent storage using localStorage, so tasks remain even after refreshing the page.

Features:
Add New Tasks: Add new tasks to your to-do list with a description and priority level (Low, Medium, High).
Edit Tasks: Modify the text of existing tasks by clicking the "Edit" button.
Mark as Completed: Click on a task to toggle its completion status (crossed out).
Delete Tasks: Remove individual tasks or delete all completed tasks with the "Clear Completed" button.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved to localStorage, meaning they persist after reloading the page.
Task Priority: Tasks are color-coded based on their priority (Green for Low, Yellow for Medium, Red for High).
Technologies Used:
HTML: For the structure and layout of the app.
CSS: For styling the user interface with a modern, responsive design.
JavaScript: For functionality, including adding, editing, and deleting tasks, managing priority, and storing tasks using localStorage.
